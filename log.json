I agree completely with that: you don&#39;t really need superb GI quality when you&#39;re developing, and it bothers me that none of the solutions out there are reasonably tweakable. I mean, who cares if it takes a ton of time to precompute some extra-quality data, especially if there&#39;s no runtime penalty at all, and at the same time it improves the quality of the realtime GI? I&#39;m talking about pesky problems like light bleeding and cubemap interpolation artifacts, Unity (enlighten) is a good example of that, the best you can do is decrease the baked data quality for quicker iteration while developing, but when you increase it for deployment you get very different results and proportionally worse runtime performance, as well as all sorts of artifacts and other shit... it&#39;s like stuck between a rock and a hard place, on one hand it&#39;s too slow for iteration anyway, while on the other hand it could be better for the final product.

So yeah there&#39;s that. Also if you&#39;re looking for mobile dev, Lumix is definitively not what you want. But Will Godot really be the correct bet? I mean right now 3.0 does look like it&#39;s targeting high end mobile, which is a choice that might be an issue if they don&#39;t keep a good backcompat with ES2<br>UWP you don&#39;t want to go there... unless you like the &quot;amazing&quot; experience of xbox deployment brought to pc!<br>As for Linux I think Lumix is not far of, although is this really relevant if you&#39;re going to make a game? Do you really want to stretch yourself doing support for multiple plat at launch? Maybe AAA can manage that, but indie sure can&#39;t and anyway any of those platform comes with it&#39;s own set of issue. But yeah if you&#39;re looking after xplat Godot will be a better bet right now.</p><p>As for 2D again, it depends on the focus of your game. And again if an engine as a specific focus it can be more performant as it won&#39;t have restriction coming from features you don&#39;t need. And it all boils down to what you&#39;re game is going to be.<br>But in the end if you&#39;re after perf, using a general purpose engine won&#39;t give you that extra boost because of all the tradeoff taken in the general design. Unfortunately there&#39;s no &quot;design to fit them all&quot;<br>So sure there&#39;s no 2D here, but is it relevant in this engine design? If you came to Lumix for 2D you&#39;re not in the correct place.</p><p>You&#39;re talking about UX more than UI. If we put aside the lake of real ingame UI in Lumix, UI in itself is the same inbetween Godot and many other engine. The UX however, and editor design is another beast. But so far Lumix is on an excellent track. (I wish Atomic was as clean on that front)<br>And sure Godot is probably more polish, especially now that Juan is fulltime on it.<br>But in the end ymmv, maybe UX will be good for you where for someone else needs it might be tedious to use. Again it all boils done to your usecase. Small mobile game? Something bigger? One man team vs small/medium sized team?<br>But sure there&#39;s always things to improve and if you have concrete exemples where Lumix is laking please share, that&#39;s the only way it can improve.</p><p>Smaller binaries is again something more important when it comes to mobile. So the focus not being on mobile here might explain why.</p><p>Has of performances:</p><blockquote>\n<p>Performance? Not better than &quot;Kinda-Meh&quot; engine is a real meh for me. I remembered, Urho3D had killed my Macbook Air.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Are you talking about Urho/Atomic or Lumix ?<br>Also Macbook for dev is kinda bait for :trollface: (because mac hw is the real &quot;kinda-meh&quot; here).<br>But except killing your macbook, what usecase, scenario Godot is handling better?</p><p>Development speed, if we put that UX point on the side, flagged as &quot;already discussed&quot; what&#39;s left in the dev speed category is each user&#39;s ability to do things.. That&#39;s not something an engine is responsible for.</p><p>Support from awesome people/community/company: all those things takes time, but so far either urho/atomic or Lumix had involvement from talented and experienced people. So is it really a metric ?</p><p>Documentation will always need love whatever the engine.. ;)</p><p>Tutorials are called academic experience and work experience for most of us. Youtube tutorial even if they are nice and all tend to scratch the surface without giving anyone a good grasp of important concepts. On that point that&#39;s my view, other may differ. But I find it annoying that there&#39;s shitone of &quot;tutorials&quot; out there with varying degree of quality, but still peoples asks for tutorial for every damn steps of the game they are trying to make. It&#39;s the &quot;do it for me pretty please&quot; mentality that does not make you grow as a person and see you never really improving. That false impression of confidence that in the end lead you to impostor syndrome (not Alanposter!) if you can&#39;t transform what tutorial brought to you in actual knowledge and handle everything with that &quot;I&#39;ll just use that recipe for my task&quot; kind of mentality without understanding any bits of it up until you&#39;re stuck again.</p>"}, {"user": "nem0", "date": "2017-09-25<br>19:48:45", "html": "animation state machines?"}, {"user": "nem0", "date": "2017-09-25<br>19:48:27", "html": "fbx import?"}, {"user": "nem0", "date": "2017-09-25<br>19:48:14", "html": "do  you have docking?"}, {"user": "nem0", "date": "2017-09-25<br>19:48:07", "html": "<span data-link-type=\"mention\" data-screen-name=\"ISylvox\" class=\"mention\">@ISylvox</span> &gt; UI is top notch"}, {"user": "ISylvox", "date": "2017-09-25<br>19:46:23", "html": "<p><span data-link-type=\"mention\" data-screen-name=\"Nyt0x_twitter\" class=\"mention\">@Nyt0x_twitter</span> , Many things.

(In the scenario of releasing a game on pc/xbox/ps4, ps4 being it&#39;s own thing anyway) The only way Vulkan would become a more widely use API in games would be that Sony start to match gnm to Vulkan.<br>But for a more general purpose engine like Godot with mobile in mind yeah Vulkan makes more sens.<br>Anyway that&#39;s where BGFX shines imho, you trade a bit of flexibility for ease of use. Because even tho bgfx is nice it still need to be architecture to represent a high level view of different API.<br>Custom shader lang make sens if you&#39;re supporting multiple API under the hood, but not much sens if you&#39;re just making a subset of glsl.<br>Dropping deferred kinda make sens for mobile/VR as the Vram cost of the gbuffer is a high price to pay.<br>But it all come down to what your target/game is.<br>And you&#39;re right if you offer very little over rolling your own code that&#39;s not worth it.

Totally understand the decision of sticking to GL3 and agree that Godot won&#39;t benefit a lot from Vulkan nor most of its users. Absolutely ditch DX12 imho, I hope Vulkan will be much better supported than OpenGL even on Windows so I don&#39;t really think there&#39;s a good reason to support it. Regarding custom shader lang, I see little point if you&#39;re locked to OpenGL anyway, exposing variables easily is cool but doesn&#39;t justify it imho, other points on this subject are bullshit. Also, ditching deferred :cry:. I get that they&#39;re simplifying things so they don&#39;t run the risk of ending with something cumbersome to maintain, and I applaud that, but when you go extremely simple you offer little incentive for people to use your engine as opposed to even something from scratch using some render abstraction lib, especially when it comes to 2D."}, {"user": "Oki28z", "date": "2017-09-25<br>10:51:43", "html": "I&#39;ll look into the code and be back later, thanks !

I&#39;d rather have less visual quality than more latency anyday. I&#39;m not sure how Fibers would perform in a zero-latency system meaning that you won&#39;t process jobs from previous frames. We already discussed that exhaustively here, and I think the best approach is to be smart about your jobs and process them as appropriate, for example, some effects aren&#39;t important so introducing latency is quite OK, while gameplay mechanics have to be processed immediately. Processing game mechanics and say particles in the same pool with same priority doesn&#39;t sound good to me at all, I&#39;d be OK with a one-frame latency for physics, so you could MT that, but the game logic, and especially the controls cannot have any latency whatsoever, and if possible even predictive compensation for 0 or negative latency."}, {"user": "benwolf", "date": "2017-09-15<br>12:48:40", "html": "Fibres now too?

I personally just keep a public readonly what also works but smells a bit for the purists.<br>Also, did you decide how you&#39;re gonna handle collections? Maybe you could provide both ways, &#39;cached&#39; collections, that are marshalled into managed objects at creation, &#39;uncached&#39; that have an underlying unmanaged object that feeds your calls to elements independently marshalling at each access, so you&#39;d just have to overload depending on the situation, and also maybe you could provide &#39;nonalloc&#39; versions when it makes sense... marshalling collections generally has a big impact in performance if you do a lot of stuff with them in scripting.

I&#39;m just saying that before dealing with extremely complicated job systems, you could optimize engines a lot simply by keeping your critical stuff simple and serial, and just getting your priorities right. If you&#39;re using a thread-safe physics engine for example, you can get velocities and extrapolate data for visual feedback while running it async at a much slower rate and people won&#39;t be able to notice the difference. I did that a few months ago with Urho and PhysX.</p>"}, {"user": "boberfly", "date": "2017-08-16<br>03:43:37", "html": "<a href=\"http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/blog/?p=30\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\">http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/blog/?p=30</a>"}, {"user": "boberfly", "date": "2017-08-16<br>03:37:41", "html": "the important thing here I guess is to make sure your codebase can easily be mended to do this, keep things simple, data-oriented and know what your immutable and mutable state is so you can reason with your threads and sync points later ;)"}, {"user": "boberfly", "date": "2017-08-16<br>03:36:09", "html": "yeah I guess they just had it tough here where they couldn&#39;t do much more to get the critical path down"}, {"user": "Alan-FGR", "date": "2017-08-16<br>03:33:29", "html": "imho, games waste too much time with stuff that could simply be &#39;postponed&#39; to other frames or just skipped altogether without much problems"}, {"user": "Alan-FGR", "date": "2017-08-16<br>03:32:47", "html": "<blockquote>\n<p>you&#39;ll always have &#39;pockets&#39; you can&#39;t make everything parallel, some problems are just serial in nature</p></blockquote>\n<p>yep, that&#39;s 100% true :P... the problem is, the basic gameplay subsystems (get input, run game logic, render/output feedback) have to obey a sequence anyway, so I don&#39;t see much sense in splitting the work while you could easily do that work in your main thread and only mt the non-essential stuff... frame-splitting makes sense if your subsystems are taking too much cpu time, however, it&#39;s not a matter of 33ms latency @ 60fps vs 33ms latency @ 30fps, because you inevitably have to do extra work in your main thread anyway, so I guess a more realistic number would be something like 45ms @ 60hz vs 33ms @ 30hz, in which case depending on the game I&#39;d pick the later anyday, but I&#39;d probably pick none :P... </p><blockquote>\n<p>just make sure your game&#39;s critical path is watertight :wink: non-critical path could have 1 or multiple frame delays eg. texture stream/bake/decode could lag a bit while your input and gameplay-critical code is super tight</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yep, this is exactly what I&#39;m talking about... optimize your basics as much as you can in your main thread and just do unimportant stuff in parallel... use buffers so you never miss vsync because of these unimportant stuff, sort them by priority (say, closer particles are more important), and if you get too many just skip the less important stuff</p>"}, {"user": "boberfly", "date": "2017-08-16<br>03:28:17", "html": "<span data-link-type=\"mention\" data-screen-name=\"Alan-FGR\" class=\"mention\">@Alan-FGR</span> for very low-latency, just make sure your game&#39;s critical path is watertight ;) non-critical path could have 1 or multiple frame delays eg. texture stream/bake/decode could lag a bit while your input and gameplay-critical code is super tight"}, {"user": "boberfly", "date": "2017-08-16<br>03:22:45", "html": "and you will get pockets, like when you render your zbuffer shadow maps or zprepass, your compute units will just sit there doing nothing otherwise"}, {"user": "boberfly", "date": "2017-08-16<br>03:21:29", "html": "it&#39;s how async compute works on GPUs too, uncontested resources can get some nice compute horsepower in the pockets of an otherwise idle GPU"}, {"user": "boberfly", "date": "2017-08-16<br>03:20:52", "html": "but if you did pipeline it you might get like 16.7ms so the same latency lets just say, but now you could hit 120fps instead of just 60fps if you didn&#39;t pipeline...."}, {"user": "boberfly", "date": "2017-08-16<br>03:20:10", "html": "<span data-link-type=\"mention\" data-screen-name=\"Alan-FGR\" class=\"mention\">@Alan-FGR</span> and yeah if you hit frame time then no need to split your frame, sure"}, {"user": "boberfly", "date": "2017-08-16<br>03:08:02", "html": "I get you about latency but I highly doubt you can have both on such a constrained system once all your optimisation strategies are exhausted entirely"}, {"user": "boberfly", "date": "2017-08-16<br>03:06:07", "html": "you&#39;ll always have &#39;pockets&#39; you can&#39;t make everything parallel, some problems are just serial in nature"}, {"user": "Alan-FGR", "date": "2017-08-16<br>03:04:34", "html": "<span data-link-type=\"mention\" data-screen-name=\"boberfly\" class=\"mention\">@boberfly</span> well, as long as you don&#39;t miss the vsync it wouldn&#39;t matter would it?... the problem is why do you have those &#39;pockets&#39; to begin with...

So far, he appreciated 2.0 that brings a lot of improvement. It&#39;s way much better than 1.0.

OSS audio libraries was GPL-ed. OK, let&#39;s make our own Audio Engine&quot; -- from the Godot Labs.</p><p>Not only Juan Linietsky (Lead Godot developer) is an engine / game developer, he was also an Audio master.

Yes, Godot devs should address this issue. And yeah,.. One of why Godot developers are handsome / beautiful is this... They knew about it, made a discussion for this topic, and listed it to their plates. In fact, Juan Linietsky (a.k.a reduz) can&#39;t wait to start rewriting Physics Engine that didn&#39;t receive some love for years (He said, it&#39;s super old). From the discussion, Physics will be addressed for 3.1 (approximately 2 month after Godot 3.0 stable release) and some candidate in this regards : </p><ul>\n<li>Newton Dynamics (Juan seems like this) : <a href=\"https://github.com/MADEAPPS/newton-dynamics\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\">https://github.com/MADEAPPS/newton-dynamics</a></li>\n<li>Bullet Physics</li>\n<li>Chipmunk</li>\n</ul>\n<p>8) Vulkan support. Well... In a matter of a few months (if not weeks) after Godot 3.0 released, it should be ready.</p><p>9) Awesome Developers (individual and/or communities) in the industry are in touch with Godot Development. Let&#39;s name a few of them:</p><ul>\n<li>Mathias N.

Most Wanted! xixixi</p><p>Other FOSS engines are Of course interesting. I love them... But, need a lot more aspects to handle to catch Godot&#39;s state.</p><p>Oh, wait...

Ozz has some well documented information and samples on blending and bone filtering. There are lots of different kinds of blending. It says nothing about bone filtering. For example: upperbody and lowerbody filtering. We would definitely need additive blending. They both use SIMD and are Multithreaded.

I think for most components like renderable/physics/audio it make senses for have only  one per type, but script component might be different.  Multiple script components helps to make &quot;tiny&quot; game logic, and only composite them as needed without go through inheritance route. e.g. Instead of having all bonus item types has their own &quot;rotator&quot; behavior, I can add &quot;rotator&quot; script component to all bonus item entities, and then only add &quot;powerup&quot; script component to  powerup items.
